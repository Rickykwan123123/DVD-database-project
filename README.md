# DVD-database-project

Introduction
Welcome to the DVD Rental Database Project, a hands-on application of PostgreSQL, the powerful open-source object-relational database system. ðŸŽ“
This project encapsulates 15 meticulously designed tables: 'actor', 'film', 'film_actor', 'category', 'film_category', 'store', 'inventory', 'rental', 'payment', 'staff', 'customer', 'address', 'city', and 'country'. Each table represents various facets of a real-world DVD rental business.
As you navigate through this project, you'll gain practical insights into the capabilities of PostgreSQL, refine your database management skills, and understand complex data structures and relationships. Welcome to a learning journey that unravels the intricate operations of a DVD rental store. 

Objective
Implement SQL querying techniques to explore and manipulate the data.
Utilize PostgreSQL database system for managing and interacting with the data.
Leverage Git commands for version control and effective collaboration.
Maintain comprehensive project documentation and a well-structured code repository here on GitHub.
SQL Analysis of DVD Rental Database
The following set of 10 diverse SQL queries provides an in-depth analysis of a DVD rental database. The queries cover various aspects of the business, including customer behaviors, film properties, rental patterns, and staff performance.
In addition, for a more in-depth view and to facilitate better comprehension, the results of each query are extracted and stored as csv files in the "query" folder. Each file corresponds to the respective query, allowing readers to explore the data in a more familiar format, aiding in data interpretation, and making it easier to generate insights or perform further analysis.
